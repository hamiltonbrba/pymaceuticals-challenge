# Pymaceuticals Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor volume in mice. The analysis includes generating summary statistics, visualizations, and examining the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Key findings highlight the efficacy of the Capomulin and Ramicane regimens.

## Key Findings
- **Capomulin and Ramicane Efficacy**: Capomulin had a mean tumor volume of 40.68 mm続 and Ramicane had a mean tumor volume of 40.22 mm続, both significantly lower than other treatments.
- **Median Tumor Volumes**: The median tumor volumes for Capomulin and Ramicane were 38.13 mm続 and 36.56 mm続, respectively.
- **Sex Distribution**: The study included an even distribution of male (49.6%) and female (50.4%) mice, ensuring robust and unbiased findings.
- **Correlation**: A strong positive correlation (r = 0.84) was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen.

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
1. Generating summary statistics for each drug regimen.
2. Creating visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and box plots to illustrate the data.
3. Conducting correlation and regression analysis to understand the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

## File Structure
- **data**: Contains the `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv` files.
- **notebooks**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis.
- **README.md**: This file.
- **pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for analysis and visualizations.

## Code Source
The code in this repository was authored by Bryan Hamilton-Brown. Some parts of the code were inspired by Stack Overflow, ChatGPT openAI, and notes from class within module 5. 

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells one by one. Ensure that the `data` folder containing the CSV files is in the same directory as the Notebook.

## Dependencies
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
